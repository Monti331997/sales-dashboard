"This is a sales performance dashboard I built for an eCommerce store. It highlights key KPis like total sales, profit, and quantity sold. I broke down sales by category, state, and payment mode to identify trends and top contributors.
One key insight I focused on was customer behavior. Using DAX. I classified customers as 'New" or 'Repeat' based on their first purchase. The analysis showed that 67% were repeat buvers-an important indicator of customer loyalty.
I also added filters and slicers for months and products to make it interactive and easy for stakeholders to explore. This dashboard helps decision-makers quickly understand performance and take action based on real insights."
